<p><i>If I yield to the remorseful redundancy of a foreword, with its
bedraggled battalions of fiercely insinuating words, it is from no mere
desire to invite the ridicule of impatient time, or to rail against that
host of vacant insincerities which betrays the animations of life. It
may be that I do not look upon words as intimidating a fixed content, or
beckoning to an inevitable style. It may be that I regard words as
flexible lures seducing the essential emptiness of life, with little,
false promises&mdash;promises of emotional and mental gain and reward; haloes
and bludgeons with which a void may attain the mirage of toiling or
dancing importance. And perhaps, in the desperate hope of achieving a
proper festival of sound, I have summoned words to a reiteration of
defeated antics, without in any way attempting to gain those exhausted
futilities known as convictions and explanations. And if, through this
foreword, I can revel in a pensive obscurity&mdash;a veil that must be
carefully removed with the reading of poems that follow&mdash;I shall feel
that I have furnished the exercise of amusement to certain sterile and
over-confident rituals of emotion and mind.</i></p>

<p><i>The poetic situation in America is, indeed, a blustering and verbose
invitation to boredom and a slight, reviling headache. When not engaged
in scrubbing the window pane ten times over, lest it prove opaque to an
astigmatic public, American poets are discovering, with great glee, the
perspiring habits and routines of sex, or naively deifying the local
mannerisms of a blithely juvenile country&mdash;a lurching, colloquial,
fist-swinging melee of milkmen depositing bottles on doorsteps and
acquiring dignity in the process; chorus-girls and farmhands telling
their troubles in a stilted slang; factory-owners falling in love with
their female employees, to the tune of delicate and novel symbolism
concerning “a longing to enter the house of her being”; ravings over the
strength and poignancy of corn-fields and country-roads&mdash;“O, the corn,
how it aches!” and “What is better than the patient and sturdy road?”&mdash;;
much roaring about the importance and hard beauty of mills and
factories&mdash;crudely smoky boxes of avarice faced by little, kneeling
poets.... Ah, the list, when extended, defies amusement. You must leave
the theater unless you desire the thankless experience of vomiting.</i></p>

<p><i>The commercial cacophony of American lusts and greeds has borrowed a
clarinet, a flute, and a saxophone from the admiration of American
poets and is one-stepping with thousands of words, after the office and
factory have closed for the day, “Swee-et Mama, well your papa’s done
gone mad!”&mdash;the jerky, leering pandemonium of actual jazz on a polished
floor interests me far more than its more proper and adulterated
echoes&mdash;the glorious American poets of our time.</i></p>

<p><i>There are, again, American poets who have turned their eyes to Europe,
yes, the fact is apparent&mdash;they have turned their eyes to Europe, and
they can, on occasion, become cynical animals, discovering seven
thousand different ways of describing the contortions that lead to
sexual intercourse, and displaying breasts and limbs with an infinite
amount of abandoned bravado. Again, they have heard of the European
Dadaists, yes, undoubtedly they have heard of the European Dadaists, and
they have now reduced the pronoun “I” to “i,” commenced their lines with
small letters, and exhibited a brave and startling hatred for commas and
separate words. In Europe, this literary revolution holds a distorted
incisiveness and many an original thought, heaved up from the
catastrophe of words. In America, certain poets, with great gusto, have
torn three buttons from their coats and are standing on their heads.
Yawning, we turn the page to the greyly psychological school of
poets&mdash;William James and Havelock Ellis, viewed with ecstasy behind a
magnifying glass, while someone provides a blurred replica of Bach’s
music.</i></p>

<p><i>That tantalizing obscurity of words, luring the nimbleness of mental
regard&mdash;subtlety&mdash;and those deliberate acrobatics that form an original
style&mdash;both are waiting for the melodrama, comedy and lecture to
subside. Alas, what a long waiting is before them&mdash;pity these two
aristocrats and admire their isolated tenacity. Drop the trivial gift of
a tear, also, upon a wilted, elaborate figure thrown into cell number
thirty-two and trying to remember that his name was once Intellect. Then
deposit the lengthened confession of a sigh upon another drooping form
known as Delicate Fantasy&mdash;an elusive Liar who ravishes colors without
mentioning their names (not the endless blue, green, white, yellow, red,
lavender, mauve, pink, brown, cerise, golden, orange, and purple of
American Imagists). They have kicked him into the cellar, damn them.
Recognize the importance of his bruises. And also, spy, in the loosely
naive tumult, an agile, self-possessed pilgrim known as Irony. They have
kicked him in the stomach, these symbols of earth triumphant.... And
now, you must not look upon these words as a stormy unfolding of
conviction and explanation. The American spectacle has aroused a mood;
words conceal the essential helplessness; and the lurking emptiness
behind life separates into little, curious divisions of sound. The
undulations have ended.</i></p>

<span class="i0">Can never stop to examine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thin line of speech that goes adventuring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where your brown hills bite the sky.<br /></span>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This vacuous, clattering spectacle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has collected the heart-beats of a nation.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Greed, like a gorged Machiavelli,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slumps down in the green plush seat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wonders whether it has not blundered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While a sentimental song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a kindly infant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Interferes with the clink of coins.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hatred, juvenile and deformed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earns the smirking oblivion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fat women mangling sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wrangling babble of ignorance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turns to silence underneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The opium of innuendoes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acrobats appear and seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be raping phantom lovers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer beautiful and fresh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But mechanically endured.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Part of the audience is also<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A battered stoic clasping worn-out mistresses.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clog-dancers enervate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thumping martyrs of their feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chorus-girls offer the lines of their bodies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With whining voices.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dreams are cheap, and green plush seats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appropriately, snugly hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The expensive hallucinations.<br /></span>
